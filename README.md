Here's some navmesh practice - as this is all self taught, any feedback you have, minor or major, is much appreciated. Message me on discord or ping me in the Arcane University!

Notably there was a section that had some rock steps as a natural staircase, but the rock steps were using a pillar asset that had near-unusable collision on their top.
In the above esp I've replaced it with a ramp, but I've also got a version with collision boxes to smooth and keep the original structure: [0_Skyblivion_Navmesh_Practice_1_collision_boxes_AAAASkybNavPractice.esp](0_Skyblivion_Navmesh_Practice_1_collision_boxes_AAAASkybNavPractice.esp)
